            <p>This is likely the best website I have built up to this point. Tinder for Dogs! Originally given to us students of a course as a project for which to design and build this website, I see there are now numerous apps and websites that have spawned from this all seemingly making lots of money!</p>
            <p>Cannot help but feel I missed my shot!ðŸ˜‚</p>

            <img src="img/tindog_website_screenshot.png" alt="A full screenshot of the entire tindog website showing the same sections as before, including the different payment plans.">

            <p>Anyways, this was an exercise in semantic HTML as well as BootStrap CSS. I was able to achieve this really cool looking colour gradient for the header section using nothing but CSS which I am still really proud of to this day.</p>
            <p>We have two download buttons, each with an SVG, one for android and one for IOS. Of course, since I don't have an app, they don't actually link anywhere, but they have hover and focus functionality.</p>
            <p>We have a brief section below which humurously informs you the app is so easy even your dog could use it. Below this, We have the testimonial section, all divs within a parent div set to use flex box. Including the logos for the different companies.</p>
            <p>Coming to the payment section, once more this is 3 parent divs with their children elements formatted within</p>

            </video>

            <p>The payment plans are fairly straightforward, bootstrap makes the CSS a breeze to do to be honest and its so consistently good.</p>
            <p>Finally the footer, this shares the colour gradient configured on the header, and again I just think this ties the whole website together so well.</p>
            <p>Because I used bootstrap, the website is fully responsive, although I will concede my class names are long as heck, but still, Bootstrap CSS is a beauty to behold.</p>
